# hello-world
Please Help me to become a full stack developer
I am a Engineering Technologies Student at Seminole State College of Florida. Although pursuing this degree program, I am primarilly interested in Web Development and Computer Programming. I hope to get a entry level job in the fields of Web development, computer programming, or other related fields.
